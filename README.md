Lithology prediction with machine learning using acoustic, electrical and nuclear logging curves. This project also includes data recovery methods based on both statistical approaches and ML.

 <h4>Logging curves Recovery (regression tasks)</h4>
 <ul>
   <li>Using clustering methods from the Scilit-learn library for statistical algorithms of filling in missing values.</li>
  <li>Application of multiple regression based on gradient boosting to recover missing measurements with CatBoost library.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h4>Lithology prediction (classification tasks)</h4>
 <ul>
   <li>Developed an algorithm based on gradient boosting implemented using the CatBoost and XGBoost libraries. Performance comparison of CatBoost and XGBoost libraries.</li>
  <li>The construction of a convolutional neural network for the implementation of the translerning mechanism. This approach makes it possible to complite the task for data from different geological and geographical regions</li>
 </ul>
